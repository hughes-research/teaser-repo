### The Six-Layer Resilience System

#### 1. **Immediate Coping** - Circuit Breakers
Emergency protection from stress overload with graduated response levels.

#### 2. **Chemical Interventions** - Medication-like Relief
Constant low-level stress relief plus emergency doses when needed.

#### 3. **Baseline Adaptation** - Learning "Normal"
Adapts to environment-specific stress levels, preventing false alarms.

#### 4. **Rest & Recovery** - Human-like Breaks
Complete input disconnection during overwhelming stress with active healing.

#### 5. **Time Perspective** - Stress Memory
Applies perspective relief based on historical stress survival patterns.

#### 6. **Mode-Aware Processing** - State-Dependent Learning
Different learning rates and strategies based on current psychological state.

### Psychological State Modeling

The system demonstrates authentic human psychological patterns:

```
Normal → Stressed → Crisis → Timeout → Recovery → Normal
```

Each state has specific characteristics:
- **Normal**: Baseline functioning, optimal learning
- **Stressed**: Elevated alertness, enhanced learning
- **Crisis**: Emergency protocols, reduced learning
- **Timeout**: Complete break, no input processing
- **Recovery**: Active healing, boosted stress relief

## Technical Details

### Hormone Dynamics

The system uses biologically-inspired hormone dynamics with exponential decay:

```python
# Hormone evolution follows first-order exponential decay
h_i(t + Δt) = h_i(t) * e^(-λᵢΔt) + I(t)

# Where:
# λᵢ = ln(2)/τᵢ (decay constant)
# τᵢ is the half-life of hormone i
# I(t) is the impulse input at time t
```

### Control Signal Generation

Control signals are generated through weighted, power-transformed hormone levels:

```python
# Non-linear control mapping
k = clamp(Σ w_i(b + δ_i * h_i^p_i) / Σw_i)

# Where:
# w_i are weights for each hormone
# b is the baseline control level
# δ_i are policy parameters
# p_i are power transformations
```

### Graph Neural Network

The value function uses a fully-connected hormone graph processed by a two-layer GCN:

```python
class ValueGCN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.gc1 = GraphConv(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.gc2 = GraphConv(hidden_dim, output_dim)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
    
    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        x = self.relu(self.gc1(x, edge_index))
        x = self.gc2(x, edge_index)
        return x.mean(dim=0)  # Global pooling
```

### Policy Gradient Learning

The system learns through policy gradient updates:

```python
# Policy update rule
δ_i ← δ_i + α * (r - V) * ∂k/∂δ_i

# Where:
# α is the learning rate
# r is the reward signal
# V is the value function estimate
# ∂k/∂δ_i is the gradient of control wrt parameters
```
